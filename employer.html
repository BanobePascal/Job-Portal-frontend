                        <h5>By Odong Gilbert, Code Ville Writer</h5>
                        <p>So you've had a crazy day, with a million deadlines 
                          and a thousand small crises. Now you have to interview 
                          candidates for a marketing assistant position. If you 
                          don't have a human resources department to guide you 
                          along, here are some tips for how to prepare for and 
                          conduct a job interview -- from the other side of the 
                          desk.</p>
                        <h5 style="padding-top: 1em">Nine Tips for Interviewers</h5>
                        <p>Remember that during the interview process,
                           candidates are deciding whether they want to work
                            for you just as much as you are trying to decide
                             whether to hire them. You have only about an hour 
                             to make a good impression on the candidate. Follow
                              these steps:</p>
                      </div>
                      <div class="col-lg-11">
                        <h6 style="padding-top: 2em">1. Write down a list of questions that directly 
                          relate to the job's responsibilities.</h6>
                        <p>"If you don't have a job description, list the key 
                          responsibilities of the position, and then draw up a 
                          list of questions that relate to those responsibilities," 
                          says John Dooney, manager of strategic resource for the
                           Society for Human Resources Management, a nonprofit 
                           association for human resources professionals.</p>
                        <h6>2. Ask behavioural questions,</h6>
                        <p> as in "tell me about a time when you..." 
                          Ask for specific examples of past performance 
                          and behaviour, says Dooney. Previous successes are a 
                          good indicator of future performance.</p>
                      </div>
                      <div class="col-lg-11">
                        <h6>3. Review the candidate's resume before the interview.</h6>
                        <p>This may seem obvious, but by preparing your interview 
                          questions and reviewing the resume, you are showing the 
                          candidate you have taken the time to ensure a productive 
                          interview.</p>
                        <h6>4. Outline the interview structure for the candidate.</h6>
                        <p> First, give a brief description of the company, and 
                          then outline the job duties. Finally, ask the applicant 
                          questions. After that, the candidate will have the
                           opportunity to ask you questions. This sets up the
                            parameters of the interview, keeps you both focused, 
                            and gives the candidate an idea of what to expect.</p>
                      </div>
                        <div class="col-lg-11">
                            <h6>5. Don't talk too much during the interview process.</h6>
                            <p> Dooney suggests hiring managers should talk only 
                              about 30 percent of the time. Allow candidates time 
                              to describe their skills and qualifications during
                               the interview. "Make sure you've covered all your
                                questions and you haven't missed anything," Dooney adds.</p>
                            <h6>6. Extend professional courtesies, says Dooney.</h6>
                            <p> Offer candidates a glass of water, and ask if they had
                               difficulty finding the place. Be on time. Consider giving
                                them a tour of the office. Give them an opportunity to 
                                speak with other team members or prospective coworkers, 
                                if appropriate.</p>
                          </div>
                          <div class="col-lg-11">
                              <h6>7. Watch nonverbal signals</h6>
                              <p>Just as you are looking for eye contact and appropriate 
                                dress, the candidate is looking for those unspoken signals
                                 from you. Be sure your tone of voice is appropriate and 
                                 professional. Clearly articulate the job's duties and the 
                                 company's mission. Dress as you normally would, and pay 
                                 attention to manners. You are a representative of your
                                  company and department, so make sure your actions reflect
                                   this. </p>
                              <h6>8. While being polite and professional, don't get too chummy.</h6>
                              <p> "Keep all your questions job-related," says Dooney. If you 
                                spend the interview chatting, you may make a hiring decision
                                 because you liked the candidate versus whether the person is 
                                 truly qualified for the job, he explains.</p>
                            </div>
                            <div class="col-lg-11">
                                <h6>9. Whether it's by email or phone, follow up</h6>
                                <p> to let candidates know whether they got the job. This is one more way of extending a professional courtesy and gives the interview process closure. </p>
